# NewsSentiment

NOTE: This is a work in progress. There is also a current limit of 100 news stories per request, and stories only go as far back as a month from now.

For my internship with Tulane Enterprise Risk Services, one of my goals was to track the sentiment of news articles related to Tulane. My streamlit application implements News API to find the articles and Gemini's API to analyze the sentiment of the articles in relation to the keyword. At the bottom of the page, you can find a saveable csv file, a summary of the average sentiment score, and the number of articles analyzed.

I will continue to update the application, adding more features and improving the accuracy of the sentiment score. Please let me know if you have any suggestions in the meantime!

Update: The application is currently down. I will update with a new link for users to interact with soon! For now, you can find a video below demonstrating the app in action.
