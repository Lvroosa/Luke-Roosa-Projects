Unlike the News Sentiment application, my Spotify application does not contain a shareable link yet, but I posted the code and a screen recording showing the application in action.

My application utilizes Spotify's API to search for up to five artists, display relevant metrics, and provide a comparison of the artist's metrics at the bottom. This application was made for fun and to practice Streamlit's capabilities, and I will likely add more changes in the future as I see fit.
